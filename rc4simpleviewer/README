SimpleViewer(c), is a flash gallery template, written by Felix Turner in Airtight Interactive.
(Please visit http://www.airtightinteractive.com for more information)

rc4simpleviewer is suitable for remote servers which you are lazy for dealing image
resizing, renaming and etc.

When you run the script in a folder of images (they should be jpg files at the moment)
it should download the script and prepare the gallery with necessary structure for you.

This version works with Simpleviewer 1.8. Also you'll need python-imaging library (AKA PIL) 
please check if it's installed before trying...
