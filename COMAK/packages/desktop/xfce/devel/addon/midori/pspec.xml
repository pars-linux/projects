                * Version bump:
                    - Bookmarks can be imported from Opera, Arora, Kazehakase, Epiphany and
                    other browser using XBEL. The XBEL support was improved in terms of
                    performance and compatibility with other applications.
                    - Colourful Tabs now work in combination with the Tab Panel. Delete
                    Private data includes Web Cache which it didn't before. And if you have
                    a small screen or mobile device, Open panels in separate windows can be
                    useful. Correct ordering of History and Trash were fixed. The Shortcuts
                    dialogue display issues were fixed.
                    - The options 'Show in toolbar' and 'Open as web app' were implemented for
                    bookmarks. So you can selectively decide what bookmarks or folders to
                    have in the bookmarkbar. And if you mark them as 'web app' bookmarks
                    open in a separate process.
                    - Several improvements related to portability and compatibility were
                    applied, for Hildon and Win32. Build fixes for certain Glib and GTK+
                    versions were applied. libnotify is now a build-time dependency.

                * Version bump:
                - Mouse gestures are fixed, linking with gold is supported, the navigation toolbar is hidden in fullscreen and the preference dialogue was tweaked a little.
                - You may notice that opening of new windows is incredibly fast and startup of Midori is faster.
                - Hotkeys involving Tab or single characters are supported now.
                - Terminating Midori with Unix signals won't trigger the crash dialogue anymore (a real crash will).
                - We have a Web Cache extension and a Tab History list now, both incredibly nice additions. Also form history was improved, it works with forms where it didn't before and saves values to disk so it works after closing Midori in-between.

                * Version bump:
                - Remove the very much disliked popup below the address field.
                - Fix user scripts, user styles and the Netscape plugin panel.
                - Improve the tab panel. It has close icons now, ellipsizes titles, tooltips and you can hide the panel operating controls now to make it really space efficient.
                - Show up tools in the compact menu button now.
                - If you like to keep open certain tabs, now you can minimize them, whic means reducing them to icons - support for this in the tab panel will follow in a future version.
                - There's a new tick mark in a dialogue in Tools > Delete private data, that tells Midori to delete the chosen information when quitting.
                - A nice goodie is that navigation history is preserved in newly opened tabs now.
                * Change default homepage; use pardus.org.tr instead of ozgurlukicin.com.
