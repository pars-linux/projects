REVIEW:

xfce4-genmon-plugin (The GenMon plugin cyclically spawns the indicate script/program, captures its output and displays the result into the panel.) (not working in 4.8 https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=880729 . there is a patch but not working)
xfce4-sensors-plugin (Reads your hardware sensor values and displays them in your panel)
xfce4-xfapplet-plugin
xfce4-indicator-plugin (A Panelplugin that uses indicator-applet to show new messages.)
