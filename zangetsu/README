Requires:

- Python
- Apache Web Server
- mod_python
- Django


Setup:

- go to the source directory of Zangetsu,
- copy 'settings-dist-default.py' as 'settings.py',
  and edit 'settings.py'..
- create the necessary directory according the WEB_URL
- copy 'blog/defaults-dist-default.py' as 'blog/defaults.py',
  and edit it..
- check 'settings.py' again to be sure everything seems okey.
- run 'python manage.py syncdb' and answer the questions.
- run 'chmod 777 db/ -R'.
- run 'python /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/django/bin/compile-messages.py -a'.
- copy htaccess file into the web directory as '.htaccess' and
  edit it (your web server setup should allow overriding defaults
  with .htaccess files at least for the directory that you're gonna
  use to publish Zangetsu).
- run your web server and check the WEB_URL. If everything's
  okey you should go to WEB_URL/admin/ with your browser and log-in
  to start writing.
