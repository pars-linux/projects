><P
>This is the first book on Python and Qt.
        There have been quite a few books on C++ and Qt, but you would
        need to be fairly adept at mentally searching and replacing
        C++ language constructs to be able to use those books for
        pleasure and profit if your chosen language is Python. The
        same holds for the extensive html documentation that comes
        with the C++ Qt library.</P
><P
>With the growing popularity of Python,
        PyQt and BlackAdder, people will start using these tools who
        don't want to translate C++ to Python to figure out what they
        are supposed to do.</P
><P
>This is the first group of people for
        whom I've written this book: beginning software developers who
        have chosen Python because it allows them to become productive
        quickly with a language and an environment that have been
        designed to accommodate &#8216;subject specialists'. That is, people
        who need to get an application done to help them with their
        work, but who are not developers by profession.</P
><P
>Then there are the experienced
        developers, people who have been coding in Visual Basic,
        Delphi or Java, and who, like the first group, now need
        something a lot more productive and portable. They will be
        able to grasp the concepts quickly, but may find a lot of use
        in the advanced code examples and the in-depth discussion of
        issues particular to PyQt.</P
><P
>Another group of possible readers
        consists of C++ developers who have turned to Python as a
        rapid prototyping language. Prototyping with the same GUI
        library they will use for their final C++ application will
        give them a definite advantage, as most of the prototype code
        will remain useful.</P
><P
>Finally there are people who are more
        experienced in Python than I am, but who want to get
        acquainted with one of the best-designed GUI toolkits
        available for the language&#8212;there is a lot of interesting
        content to be found in this book for them, too.</P
><P
>My aim in writing this book was to
        create a genuine vademecum for Python, PyQt and GUI
        programming. If you keep referring to this book a year after
        you've acquired it, if you can find the answer to most of your
        daily and quite a few of your exceptional problems, and if you
        tend to keep this book in the vicinity of your desk, then I
        will have succeeded.</P
