Printing issues to look out for:
  orphans and widows
  font size for programlistings
  location of sidebars (not running in the text)
  quality of the images, and their position
  captions in italic
  if at all possible, not set in Times New Roman!


Write a small sidebar on 'what's self' - explain about namespace, about
the fact that Python code itself is organized as a dictionary. Parent class hierarchy traversal, etc.


Topics from the mailing list:

* compiling and installing from source
* overloading and overloading conflicts with sip
* running on embedded Qt
* internationalisation
* event filtes
* insertion order in QListView
* sip

Note: fit in a chapter about event handling, since I haven't discussed
it at all.

QGList.locate index error with layout.py - removing children from
a layout (removeChild doesn't work)

Note that inserting items in a qlistview will insert them into the top
(reverse from what you might expect)

BlackAdder: no shortcuts (as in Eric) in the debugger. variable 
        Treeview doesn't work. Output of print etc. disappears. There should 
        be an output window. How do I set a breakpoint? Doesn't seem
        to register. Dedent doesn't work.

New notes: if a script contains an error, only the exit status
is given, not the error.
