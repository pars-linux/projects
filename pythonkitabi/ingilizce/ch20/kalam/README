   Kalam - the undocumented, extensible editor.

Kalam is an editor written in Python and PyQt as an example
application to accompany the third part of the book "Gui programming
with Python and Qt", published by OpenDocs.

You can extend Kalam with macro's written in Python. See edmund.py
for an example. Consult either the book, or the file kalamconfig.py
to configure Kalam, using, for instance startup.py.

   Installation

In order to run Kalam, the kalam main directory needs to be on the
Python path. On Unix, you can add something like:
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/kalam/directory:$PYTHONPATH to .bashrc. On
Windows, you must edit that system variable using the Control Panel.

   Requirements:

you must have Python (>2.0) and PyQt (>2.4) installed. PyQt depends
on sip. You can get Python from www.python.org and PyQt from
www.thekompany.com.
