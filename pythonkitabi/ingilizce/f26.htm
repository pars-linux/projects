><P
>The main topic of this book is application
      development using PyQt, a library extension to the Python
      programming language &#8212; a library that is meant to form the
      basis for GUI programming. PyQt is free software, but there is
      also a commercial IDE available, BlackAdder, that is specially
      written to assist working with PyQt. I will show you the ins and
      outs of PyQt by developing a complete and complex application.</P
><P
>Like most thirty&#8211;somethings who
      started programming in their teens, I've worked with a lot of
      different technologies. I started with Sinclair Basic, going on
      to Turbo Pascal and SNOBOL &#8212; I have developed for Windows
      in pure C, with Borland Pascal and with Visual Basic. I've done
      my stretch with Oracle Forms, and served as a Java developer. On
      Linux, I've wet my feet with Free Pascal, with C++, using XForms
      and Qt. And just when I was getting fond of Qt and C++, I found
      out about Python &#8212; a few years ago now. I found
      programming with PyQt to be a lot more fun than anything else,
      and productive fun, too.</P
><P
>For sheer productivity, nothing beats
      Python and PyQt. And while there's always something new to learn
      or explore in Python, if you're in the mood, it's easy and
      pleasant to write useful applications from the first day. No
      other programming language or library has ever given me
      that.</P
><P
>So, when Cameron Laird, during a
      discussion on the comp.lang.python newsgroup suggested that I'd
      write a book on this particular way of developing GUI
      applications with Python, I started to think &#8212; and more
      than think. I started to contact publishers, until one day Shawn
      Gordon of TheKompany brought me into contact with Joshua Drake
      of Opendocs. I started writing text and code almost
      immediately.</P
><P
>Joshua's patience has been monumental
      &#8212; I should have written this book between February and
      May, but it took me until November. All I can say for myself is
      that a lot of effort has gone into the book. I discuss most of
      the concepts and classes of the Qt library, which might be
      useful not only to Python developers, but also to C++
      developers, and I have written a <SPAN
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>lot</I
></SPAN
> of
      example scripts.</P
><P
>Where Bruce Eckel (of <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Thinking
        in Java</I
> fame) favors small example programs
      because they clearly illustrate the matter in hand, John Grayson
      in <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Python and Tkinter</I
> argues that larger
      real-life applications are more useful because they don't hide
      the complexity that is a part of any programming effort.</P
><P
>Both are right, of course, so I decided to
      give you both small examples and one really large one. Part I
      and II of this book  concern themselves with concepts: here the
      examples are small, often amounting to less than one page of
      code. Part III takes you through the development of a complete,
      complex application. In this case an editor, but one with a lot
      of extra features. I think it's a very good way of learning what
      developing complex applications entails - I spare you none of
      the nasty details that software development entails.</P
><P
>I have tried to keep to a very clear style
      of coding, with few or none of the clever hacks that are
      possible in Python &#8212; like adding the methods of one class
      to another, or creating lists of function objects. The purpose
      is to tell you about writing real applications using Python and
      Qt. Clever hacking has its place, but is best savored on its
      own.</P
><P
>The emphasis of the book is also firmly on
      application development, not on creating graphics per se &#8212;
      although several techniques are mentioned here and there that
      have to do with creating charts and graphs.</P

><P
>The combination of Python and Qt is
        extremely powerful, and is used in a wide variety of
        applications. People are scripting OpenGL applications with
        it, creating complex 3D models, animation applications,
        writing database applications, games, utilities and hardware
        monitoring applications. It is used in open source projects,
        but also by large companies, like Disney Television and Media.
        If you're not working on embedded software, hardware drivers
        or a new operating system, chances are that PyQt is the right
        choice for you, too.</P
