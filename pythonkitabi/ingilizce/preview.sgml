  <title>About this book</title>

  <para>I've been working with Python and PyQt for a few years now.
    Working with PyQt is lot of fun, and I have always tried to share
    the fun with other Pythoneers. I mean, I've worked with a lot of
    technologies: I've done Windows programming in pure C, with
    Borland Pascal and with Visual Basic. I've done my stretch with
    Oracle Forms, and served as a Java developer. On Linux, I've wet
    my feet with Free Pascal, with C++: with XForms and with Qt.
    However, for sheer productivity, nothing beats Python and PyQt.
    And while there's always something new to learn or explore, it's
    easy and pleasant to write useful applications from the first day.
    No other environment has ever given me that.</para>

  <para>When Cameron Laird, during a discussion on the
    comp.lang.python newsgroup suggested that I'd write a book on this
    particular way of GUI programming with Python, I started to think
    - and more than think. I started to write publishers, until one
    day Joshua Drake of Opendocs wrote <emphasis>me</emphasis>. I
    started writing almost immediately.</para>

  <para>I'm still very busy writing chapters for this book, and the
    text as you find it here isn't very polished. You will encounter a
    lot of XXX - mostly when I don't know what chapter I will refer
    to. The two large applciations mentioned are tentative. (Although
    I've nearly done the editor.) There is duplication of text: some
    intentional, some caused by the fact that when I started writing,
    I couldn't refer to prior knowledge. And my native tongue is
    Dutch, not English. I've probably slit the occasional infinitive,
    and, worse, used a present perfect where an imperfect would have
    been preferable (and vice versa).</para>

  <para>I really appreciate any and all comments you can send me:
    either directly (boud@rempt.xs4all.nl), or via opendocs (XXX -
    Joshua?) - on minor matters of spelling, or major matters of
    organisation. If you cannot run the examples, or don't get my
    meaning. Commenting on XXX's isn't very useful: I'll be doing a
    grep on them when all chapters have been written.</para>

  <para>Currenly, I'm progressing at a rate of about one chapter a
    week - but I hope to step that up a bit in the coming month, since
    I want to have most of the text done before the end of
    July.</para>
