    <title>Preface</title>

    <para id="para-book-9">The main topic of this book is application
      development using PyQt, a library extension to the Python
      programming language &mdash; a library that is meant to form the
      basis for GUI programming. PyQt is free software, but there is
      also a commercial IDE available, BlackAdder, that is specially
      written to assist working with PyQt. I will show you the ins and
      outs of PyQt by developing a complete and complex application.</para>

    <para id="para-book-10">Like most thirty&ndash;somethings who
      started programming in their teens, I've worked with a lot of
      different technologies. I started with Sinclair Basic, going on
      to Turbo Pascal and SNOBOL &mdash; I have developed for Windows
      in pure C, with Borland Pascal and with Visual Basic. I've done
      my stretch with Oracle Forms, and served as a Java developer. On
      Linux, I've wet my feet with Free Pascal, with C++, using XForms
      and Qt. And just when I was getting fond of Qt and C++, I found
      out about Python &mdash; a few years ago now. I found
      programming with PyQt to be a lot more fun than anything else,
      and productive fun, too.</para>

    <para id="para-book-11">For sheer productivity, nothing beats
      Python and PyQt. And while there's always something new to learn
      or explore in Python, if you're in the mood, it's easy and
      pleasant to write useful applications from the first day. No
      other programming language or library has ever given me
      that.</para>

    <para id="para-book-12">So, when Cameron Laird, during a
      discussion on the comp.lang.python newsgroup suggested that I'd
      write a book on this particular way of developing GUI
      applications with Python, I started to think &mdash; and more
      than think. I started to contact publishers, until one day Shawn
      Gordon of TheKompany brought me into contact with Joshua Drake
      of Opendocs. I started writing text and code almost
      immediately.</para>

    <para id="para-book-13">Joshua's patience has been monumental
      &mdash; I should have written this book between February and
      May, but it took me until November. All I can say for myself is
      that a lot of effort has gone into the book. I discuss most of
      the concepts and classes of the Qt library, which might be
      useful not only to Python developers, but also to C++
      developers, and I have written a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of
      example scripts.</para>

    <para id="para-book-14">Where Bruce Eckel (of <citetitle>Thinking
        in Java</citetitle> fame) favors small example programs
      because they clearly illustrate the matter in hand, John Grayson
      in <citetitle>Python and Tkinter</citetitle> argues that larger
      real-life applications are more useful because they don't hide
      the complexity that is a part of any programming effort.</para>
    
    <para id="para-book-15">Both are right, of course, so I decided to
      give you both small examples and one really large one. Part I
      and II of this book  concern themselves with concepts: here the
      examples are small, often amounting to less than one page of
      code. Part III takes you through the development of a complete,
      complex application. In this case an editor, but one with a lot
      of extra features. I think it's a very good way of learning what
      developing complex applications entails - I spare you none of
      the nasty details that software development entails.</para>

    <para id="para-book-16">I have tried to keep to a very clear style
      of coding, with few or none of the clever hacks that are
      possible in Python &mdash; like adding the methods of one class
      to another, or creating lists of function objects. The purpose
      is to tell you about writing real applications using Python and
      Qt. Clever hacking has its place, but is best savored on its
      own.</para>

    <para id="para-book-17">The emphasis of the book is also firmly on
      application development, not on creating graphics per se &mdash;
      although several techniques are mentioned here and there that
      have to do with creating charts and graphs.</para>

    <sect1 id="PrefaceUsingPyqt"><title>Who is using PyQt</title>

      <para id="para-book-18">The combination of Python and Qt is
        extremely powerful, and is used in a wide variety of
        applications. People are scripting OpenGL applications with
        it, creating complex 3D models, animation applications,
        writing database applications, games, utilities and hardware
        monitoring applications. It is used in open source projects,
        but also by large companies, like Disney Television and Media.
        If you're not working on embedded software, hardware drivers
        or a new operating system, chances are that PyQt is the right
        choice for you, too.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="prefaceIntendedFor"><title>For whom is this book
        intended</title>

      <para id="para-book-19">This is the first book on Python and Qt.
        There have been quite a few books on C++ and Qt, but you would
        need to be fairly adept at mentally searching and replacing
        C++ language constructs to be able to use those books for
        pleasure and profit if your chosen language is Python. The
        same holds for the extensive html documentation that comes
        with the C++ Qt library.</para>

      <para id="para-book-20">With the growing popularity of Python,
        PyQt and BlackAdder, people will start using these tools who
        don't want to translate C++ to Python to figure out what they
        are supposed to do.</para>

      <para id="para-book-21">This is the first group of people for
        whom I've written this book: beginning software developers who
        have chosen Python because it allows them to become productive
        quickly with a language and an environment that have been
        designed to accommodate &lsquo;subject specialists'. That is, people
        who need to get an application done to help them with their
        work, but who are not developers by profession.</para>

        <!-- todo: please break above paragraph into more than one
      sentence. Br: hoc ille. -->

      <para id="para-book-22">Then there are the experienced
        developers, people who have been coding in Visual Basic,
        Delphi or Java, and who, like the first group, now need
        something a lot more productive and portable. They will be
        able to grasp the concepts quickly, but may find a lot of use
        in the advanced code examples and the in-depth discussion of
        issues particular to PyQt.</para>

      <para id="para-book-23">Another group of possible readers
        consists of C++ developers who have turned to Python as a
        rapid prototyping language. Prototyping with the same GUI
        library they will use for their final C++ application will
        give them a definite advantage, as most of the prototype code
        will remain useful.</para>

      <para id="para-book-24">Finally there are people who are more
        experienced in Python than I am, but who want to get
        acquainted with one of the best-designed GUI toolkits
        available for the language&mdash;there is a lot of interesting
        content to be found in this book for them, too.</para>

      <para id="para-book-25">My aim in writing this book was to
        create a genuine vademecum for Python, PyQt and GUI
        programming. If you keep referring to this book a year after
        you've acquired it, if you can find the answer to most of your
        daily and quite a few of your exceptional problems, and if you
        tend to keep this book in the vicinity of your desk, then I
        will have succeeded.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="prefaceHowToRead"><title>How to read this book</title>

      <para id="para-book-26">Like ancient Gaul, this book is divided
        in three parts. The first part details the installation of
        PyQt and of BlackAdder. Then the book takes you through a tour
        of the interface of BlackAdder. You might want to read this
        part in order. There is also a small chapter that introduces
        programming with Python, in case you are not already familiar
        with the language.</para>

      <para id="para-book-27">The second part deals with the concepts
        behind Python and PyQt. You don't need to read this part in
        order, but the chapters will give you a solid feel for the lay
        of the land, and will enable you to find your way in the PyQt
        or Qt class documentation (which is copious and excellent).
        Also, if you run into inexplicable behavior, you might want to
        consult, for instance, the chapter on objects and references.
        The order of the chapters doesn't matter a whole lot.</para>

      <para id="para-book-28">Part three is where the real fun starts.
        From humble, but solid, beginnings, we will build, chapter by
        chapter, a very real application. This part is probably best
        read in order, but there are occasional excursional chapters
        that you might want to read before anything else, such as the
        chapter on unit testing.</para>

      <para id="para-book-29">Finally, there are the appendices.
        <xref linkend="readingDocumentation"> is useful if you don't
        know anything about C++, but still want to read the C++-based
        Qt documentation. The second appendix,
        <xref linkend="sip">, tells you how to wrap your own C++
        extension libraries &mdash; possibly based on Qt &mdash; using
        sip, the same tool that is used to create PyQt. <xref
        linkend="pyqwt"> deals with PyQwt and NumPy, an
        extension library for plotting and graphic.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="prefaceConventions"><title>Conventions</title>

      <para id="para-book-30">Code is always printed in a monospaced
        font - like this:
      </para>

      <programlisting>
class Test:
    def printTest(self):
        print self
      </programlisting>

      <para id="para-book-31">This also holds for references to bits
        of code in the running text. If I cite a function in the text,
        it is done like this: <function>printTest()</function> &mdash;
        i.e., I generally don't quote the parameter list. This makes
        it easier to follow the run of the text</para>

      <para id="para-book-32">Even though PyQt is a cross-platform
        toolkit (and I've tested most of the examples on Windows,
        too), all development has been done on two Linux computers: my
        laptop &lsquo;maldar', and my main system, &lsquo;calcifer',
        named after one of the main characters in Diana Wynne Jones'
        <citetitle>Howl's Moving Castle</citetitle>. Because
        BlackAdder wasn't ready when I wrote this book, I used XEmacs
        and Bash (the command line shell) to create and test all
        examples. That's why you will often see prompts in
        illustrations, and not so often screenshots of
        BlackAdder:</para>

      <para id="para-book-33">If you are using Windows, you can use a
        DOS box to emulate the <application>Bash</application> shell,
        but it won't be quite as convenient.</para>

      <para id="para-book-34">Finally, it is a widely-honored
        convention in programming literature, and especially in Python
        books, to make allusions and puns that are related to the
        punny names of the product. By rights I should have filled my
        code with witty allusions to the British comedy series
        <citetitle>Monty Python</citetitle> and
        <citetitle>BlackAdder</citetitle>. However, excellent and
        essential as these are, it's been long years since I last
        watched those on the television, and I don't feel quite up to
        it. I've done my best, but don't expect too much!</para>

    <para id="para-book-35">A note on versions: when I wrote this book
        I mostly used the stable 2.x versions of Qt,  but as soon as
        betas of Qt 3.x became available, I started integrating
        information about its improvements in the text. I will note
        wherever one version is different from the other. On the
        Opendocs webforum for this book you'll find versions of the
        examples both for Qt 2.x and Qt 3.x.</para>

    <sect1 id="prefaceAck"><title>Acknowledgments</title>

      <para id="para-book-36">Writing a book started out fun, but it
        soon became far more work than I imagined. My wife, Irina, and
        my children, Naomi, Rebecca and Menna were very patient with
        me when I locked myself in the study day after day, night
        after night. But my children <emphasis>have</emphasis> asked
        me never to write a book again. For now I'm inclined to agree,
        but we'll see.</para>

      <para id="para-book-37">Phil Thompson wrote the software that
        this book is all about &mdash; and has fixed bugs faster than
        I could write chapters. Cameron Laird is responsible for
        egging me on to start writing, and Shawn Gordon for
        introducing me to Joshua Drake, who dared to take the book on.
        Michael Holloway, the editor, has fixed lots of bad English
        and made this book a better book.</para>

      <para id="para-book-38">Neelakantan Krishmaswami is ultimately
        responsible for getting me to look at Python at all &mdash;
        everyone needs someone else to help him over the
        indentation-is-block-marking hurdle, and Neel helped
        me.</para>

      <para id="para-book-39">Jim Bublitz and Wilken Boie have
        contributed largely to
        <xref linkend="sip"> &mdash; Jim by writing the introduction,
        and Wilken by writing the overview of directives. Gerard
        Vermeulen wrote <xref linkend="pyqwt">. I've been editing
        their texts, though, so any mistakes are mine. Cameron Laird
        gave persmission to use the graphics of a remote control for
        <xref linkend="ch5">. Bruce Sass took the time to explain
        about Debian packaging. Steve Purcell helped with the chapter
        on unit-testing.</para>

      <para id="para-book-40">The following people have helped me
        learn about Python, Qt and the combination in the past years,
        on the PyKDE mailing list (set up by Torsten Horstmann) and
        the Python newsgroups: Aditya Bhambri, Albert Wagner, Anshul

    <chapter><title>Envoi</title>

      <para id="para-book-46">And that's it &mdash; apart from the
        appendices. There is a lot more I would like to write about,
        for example, a chapter on using the
        <application>mxODBC</application> database driver together
        with Qt's <classname>QTable</classname>. I would have liked a
        chapter dedicated to <classname>QEvent</classname> and
        <classname>QEventLoop</classname>. More discussion of Qt's
        great <classname>QTextEdit</classname> text editor, would have
        been nice (but I had already started on a Python
        implementation of an editor widget with
        <classname>QScrollView</classname>). A small example game or
        an editor implemented entirely in Python would be fun. Oh, and
        the Qt OpenGL module has been wrapped too. Wait! I don't want
        to stop writing&mdash;the subject is large, and there is
        something new to discover every day... Well, all I can say,
        since I have to stop now, is: have fun, and meet me at the
        webforum Opendocs provides for this book, comp.lang.python, or
        on the PyKDE mailing list.</para>

    <para id="para-book-52">This bibliography covers the sources I
      have used while writing this book. Most of the books are fairly
      to extremely well known, such as Code Complete or Design
      Patters. It's the closest the programming field has to a
      canon.</para>

    <para id="para-book-53">A lot of the generally recommended books,
      such as Fowler's Refactoring are not really suited to Python.
      These books (and this holds for Design Patterns as well) are
      more concerned with C++ or Java &mdash; that is, rather
      low-level languages where the developer has to do a lot
      himself.</para>
