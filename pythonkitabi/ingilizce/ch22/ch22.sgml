  <para id="para-ch22-1">In this chapter we quickly walk through the
    various components of the BlackAdder IDE. Once you have BlackAdder
    installed, you can start it by typing <command>ba</command> at the
    Unix shell prompt, or double-clicking the new icon on your
    desktop. You'll be greeted by a stylish splash screen, followed by
    the BlackAdder application window.</para>

  <note><para id="para-ch22-2">Please keep in mind that this chapter
      was written using the <emphasis>beta</emphasis> version of
      BlackAdder. As a result, certain aspects of BlackAdder were not yet
      in their final form. For instance, the toolbar icons are expected to
      change.</para>

  <para id="para-ch22-12">Most of the toolbars are used when
      designing forms, as they represent different widgets and layout
      strategies. These widget buttons really belong in a floating
      tool palette, but let's gloss over that user interface design
      nicety.</para>

    <para id="para-ch22-13">Going from left to right and top to bottom
      on the previous image, we encounter the following
      toolbars:</para>


    <sect2><title>File toolbar</title>

      <para id="para-ch22-14">This toolbar contains buttons that can be
        used to create, open and save BlackAdder projects, single
        Python scripts and dialog designs. The last two buttons are
        used to compile either the current dialog design, or all
        dialog designs in the current project. In this case,
        compilation means that the XML-based designs are converted to
        usable Python code. Running a project also means that all form
        designs will be compiled to Python.</para>

      scripts and projects, debug scripts and projects, restart
      debugging, continue running while debugging, single stepping,
      clear the breakpoints in the currently edited script, clear all
      breakpoints set in the whole project, and cancel or stop

        manager toolbar. Again, from left to right, there are buttons
        to resize widgets, insert a horizontal, vertical and grid
        layout manager, remove the current layout manager and insert a
        spacer object (the spacer is the the curious springy
        thing).</para>

        and LCD number, a line, a progressbar, and finally, a textview
        and a more complex textbrowser (this is a small html browser
        in itself). These last two buttons are used to insert rich

      <para id="para-ch22-26">The first toolbar on the third row has
        three buttons. The first resets your cursor to a pointer. This
        is useful if you want to select a widget in your design, but
        have previously pressed another button. The second allows you
        to graphically connect signals and slots between elements on
        screen. The last button helps you put all the components of
        your design in the right tab order.</para>

      <para id="para-ch22-28">The last four toolbars contain more
        widgets: pushbutton, toolbutton, radio button and checkbox.
        Then we have group box, button group, frame and tab-bar, next
        listbox, treeview, iconview  and table. Finally you get
        line-editor, spin box, multi-line editor, slider and
        dial.</para>

  <para id="para-ch22-31">A BlackAdder project is a simple entity: a
      grouping of Python scripts and GUI form designs, and perhaps a
      few extraneous files and folders. You start a project by
      choosing <guimenuitem>New Project</guimenuitem> from the
      <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.</para>

      close BlackAdder and restart it, it will automatically open your
      projects again. Every project has its own window in BlackAdder.
      You can have more than one project open at a time, each in a
      separate MDI window, and each with its own set of panes. (Again,
      this is not a good example to emulate; see
       <xref linkend="ch11"> for a discussion of document/view

    <indexterm>
  <primary>ruby</primary>
  </indexterm>
  <para id="para-ch22-42">As you can see, there are six tab panels:
      General, Python, Ruby, Editor, Form Editor and Debugger. In its
      current incarnation, BlackAdder supports not only Python, but
      also another scripting language: Ruby
      (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Ruby was created by the Japanese
      hacker Yukihiro Matsumoto, and is quite akin to Python. In this
      book I don't concern myself with the Ruby bindings to Qt.</para>

    <para id="para-ch22-43">Most of the options are quite
      self-explanatory. You can ask BlackAdder to not show its splash
      screen, to automatically open the most recently opened project
      file, to alter the font used in the editor and interpreter
      windows, to show a grid in the forms editor, and whether or not
      to show certain categories of variables in the debugger.</para>

    <indexterm>
  <primary>indenting</primary><secondary>with four spaces</secondary>
  </indexterm>
  <para id="para-ch22-44">One thing I advise you to change is the
      default indentation width in the Editor tab. Python source code
      is best appreciated when you write it using an indentation level
      of four spaces and no tabs. The auto-indent is also
      helpful.</para>

  <primary>scintilla</primary>
  </indexterm>
  <para id="para-ch22-46">The BlackAdder editor is based on Neil
      Hodgson's Scintilla editor, which is also available for Linux
      and Windows as a stand-alone editor, called SciTE
      (http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html).</para>

    <indexterm>
  <primary>syntax highlighting</primary>
  </indexterm>
  <para id="para-ch22-47">This editor has a few very nice features.
      The syntax highlighting for Python (and many other languages) is
      nearly instantaneous. It also offers auto-indent. This means
      that you never have to press TAB to indent another level&mdash;
      the editor knows when to indent based on the contents of the
      previous line.</para>

    <indexterm>
  <primary>code folding</primary>
  </indexterm>
  <para id="para-ch22-48">You can also fold in functions and
      classes. In the gray vertical bar on the left of the editor
      pane, there are small horizontal lines, akin to minus signs.
      These correspond to <function>class</function>,
      <function>def</function> and other block statements. You can
      click on the minus sign, and suddenly the whole block disappears
      under its first line, and a thin line is drawn over the width of
      the pane, indicating the fold:</para>

    <para id="para-ch22-50">The Scintilla editor component has other
      interesting features, such as Python tooltips, but these weren't
      integrated in the beta version of BlackAdder I used to write
      this book.

  <sect1><title>Python shell</title>

    <indexterm>
  <primary>interpreter window</primary>
  </indexterm>
  <para id="para-ch22-51">As a final feature, BlackAdder offers a
      Python shell in a separate window. This is mainly useful for
      quickly trying out certain ideas. You activate it by choosing
      <guimenuitem>Python Interpreter</guimenuitem> in the
      <guimenu>Window</guimenu> menu.</para>

        </caption>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>

    <para id="para-ch22-53">BlackAdder doesn't have an output window,
      but if you run your scripts in the debugger, all output will
      appear in the Python shell window.</para>

    <para id="para-ch22-54">Even more interestingly, your debugged
      script runs in the same interpreter as this window. This means
      that if you are debugging a script, you can alter the value of
      any variable from the shell window, just by assigning it. You
      can even call class methods or other functions.</para>


  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Conclusion</title>

    <para>That concludes the tour of the BlackAdder interface - at
      least, the interface as it was during the last Beta. BlackAdder
      is quite a traditional IDE, and it should take no effort at all
      to get comfortable with it.</para>
