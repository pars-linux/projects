  <title>Reading the Qt Documentation</title>

  <para id="para-documentation-1">Qt is originally a C++ GUI toolkit,
    and PyQt is just a wrapper around it. Fortunately, Qt is very well
    designed and makes full use of the object-oriented qualities of
    C++, so the translation is very comfortable, and PyQt feel like a
    real Python library.</para>

  <!-- XXX - will this be true? -->
  <para id="para-documentation-2">BlackAdder includes a copy of the Qt
    class documentation (nineteen megabytes of html text) that has
    been fully translated to Python. Of course, if you want to use a
    more recent version of PyQt than that which comes with BlackAdder,
    or if you use PyQt on itself, then you need to read the C++
    documentation for all the details that I didn't have space to
    discuss in this book. After all, this book teaches you how to use
    the toolkit to create complete applications, and isn't a mere
    duplication of the class documentation.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-4">Fortunately, reading C++
    documentation for use from Python isn't very difficult. In fact,
    the translation to Python idiom that is included with BlackAdder
    has been achieved for the greater part with a few find & replace
    scripts. However, if your knowledge of C++ (or C) is limited to
    knowing that it exists, then you might want to read this appendix
    for some guidance.</para>

    <title>Using KDE to have quick access to the Qt
      documentation</title>

    <para id="para-documentation-5">If you are using KDE on Unix/X11,
      you can create new internet shortcuts that take you to the Qt
      class documentation in an instant.</para>

    <para id="para-documentation-6">KDE has a wonderful feature,
      called the run command window, in which you can type a short
      abbreviation (like  "gg" for the Google search engine), followed
      by a colon and an argument.</para>

    <para id="para-documentation-7">If you add
      "file://usr/lib/qt2/doc/html/\1.html" in
      <application>KControl</application>, section Web
      Browsing/Enhanced Browsing:</para>

    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata scale="40" fileref="appendices/qtshortcut1.eps">

        <caption><para id="para-documentation-8">Creating a shortcut
            to the Qt documentation</para>
        </caption>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>

    <para id="para-documentation-9">Then you will be able to access al
      Qt documentation by typing "qt:qobject", for instance. What you
      are typing is the name of the html document that contains the
      class information: all these documents have the classname as a
      filename, all in lowercase.</para>

    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>

          <imagedata scale="40" fileref="appendices/qtshortcut2.eps">

        <caption><para id="para-documentation-10">Using a shortcut to
            the Qt documentation</para>
        </caption>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>

    <para id="para-documentation-11">Note that the shortcut
      (file://usr/lib/qt2/doc/html/\1.html) should point to the place
      where your qt (or BlackAdder - that would work too)
      documentation resides. The element after the directory path
      (\1.html) is a simple substitution argument&mdash; \1 is
      replaced by what you type after the colon.</para>

    <para id="para-documentation-12">You can quickly access the run
      command window by pressing ALT-F2 in KDE's standard
      configuration.</para>

  </note>

  <para id="para-documentation-13">Let's take a simple Qt class as an
    example: <classname>QLabel</classname>. It's a good idea to open
    the Qt class documentation in your browser window (remember the
    KDE shortcut) and keep that in view.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-14">First, the documentation tells you
    that the <classname>QLabel</classname> class includes
    <filename>qlabel.h</filename>: <emphasis>#include
      &lt;qlabel.h&gt;</emphasis>. This means about the same as a
    Python import statement. You can disregard it.</para>

    <!-- todo: the first sentence above doesn't appear to be a
  complete sentence. Br: fixed-->


  <para id="para-documentation-15">The methods that do not return
    anything, but have the same name as the class, are the C++
    constructors. Simply call them with the right arguments. Don't pay
    attention to any spurious asterisks (*) or ampersands (&) around
    the arguments to the function: what matters is the type, like
    <classname>QWidget</classname>. Don't pay attention to the
    <varname>const</varname> keyword either.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-16">If there is an equals sign (=)
    after the variable name, then the function can use a default
    parameter, just like in Python. Again, just like in Python,
    booleans are zero or one. However, a default
    argument of zero, has a default argument of None in Python. This
    is important if you want to use two out of three arguments: then
    you must also mention the middle man (you can safely drop any
    tailing default arguments you don't need):</para>

  <programlisting>
label=QLabel("text", None, "name")
  </programlisting>

  <para>versus</para>

  <programlisting>
label=QLabel("text")
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-17">Public members are instance methods
    of objects. If you call a public member, you should always prefix
    the call with the name of the object you have created (or
    <varname>self</varname> if you are calling the method from within
    the object). For example:</para>

  <programlisting>
print label.text()
  </programlisting>


  <para id="para-documentation-18">Slots are in no way different from
    ordinary functions in Python, so what holds for public members
    also holds for public slots. Protected member variables are a
    vague kind of private&mdash;if you create the
    <classname>QLabel</classname> from Python, you can access the
    protected members, like <varname>drawContents()</varname>, without
    problems, but if the <classname>QLabel</classname> has been
    created from a C++ class then you cannot access the protected
    member functions.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-19">Properties are currently not
    supported by PyQt&mdash;everything you can set and get with
    properties is also accessible by <function>get()</function> and
    <function>set()</function> methods.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-20">If you are reading the detailed
    description of a class, you will often come across snippets of C++
    code. These are easy to translate, too. Just keep in mind that
    both a double semi-colon (::) or an arrow (->) translate to a
    Python dot (.). And you don't need braces or final semicolons, of
    course. Or <function>new</function> statements. For
    instance:</para>

  <programlisting>
    QLabel *label = new QLabel;
    label->setFrameStyle( QFrame::Panel | QFrame::Sunken );
    label->setText( "first line\nsecond line" );
    label->setAlignment( AlignBottom | AlignRight );
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-21">Could become in Python:</para>

  <programlisting>
    label = new QLabel()
    label.setFrameStyle( QFrame.Panel or QFrame.Sunken )
    label.setText( "first line\nsecond line" )
    label.setAlignment( Qt.AlignBottom or Qt.AlignRight )
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-22">Note also that certain pre-defined
    values, called constants in C++ (and lots of other languages), are
    placed either in a certain <emphasis>class</emphasis>, not
    <emphasis>object instances</emphasis> or in the
    <classname>Qt</classname> pseudoclass. Thus, the
    <varname>Panel</varname> or <varname>Sunken</varname> constants
    are accessed from the <classname>QFrame</classname> class, while
    the <varname>AlignBottom</varname> and
    <varname>AlignRight</varname> constants are taken from the
    <classname>Qt</classname> pseudoclass. Note also that it isn't
    necessary to prefix <classname>Qt</classname> in C++, but that
    this is obligatory in Python.</para>


  <para id="para-documentation-23">A bit like constants are
    <emphasis>static</emphasis> methods, and are defined on the
    class:</para>

  <programlisting>
QObject.connect()  
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-24"><classname>QLabel</classname>
    doesn't have any signals or static members. For those we had
    better look at another class:
    <classname>QScrollbar</classname>.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-25">Signals have already been discussed
    in detail in <xref linkend="ch6">. Here I only want to mention the
    way you must remove any fluff from the declaration. Signals are
    placed in a Python dictionary by <application>sip</application>,
    so you really want to get the string argument to
    <function>SIGNAL()</function> right.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-26">So, if there are no arguments to
    the signal, you can just copy it, including the brackets. If there
    are arguments you need to copy the entire argument list, but not
    the variable name. So:</para>

  <programlisting>
void valueChanged ( int value ) 
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-27">Can be used as:</para>

  <programlisting>
QObject.connect(sbar,SIGNAL("valueChanged(int)"),someFunction)
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-28">On the other hand, if there are
    asterisks involved, then you have to copy those, too. In
    <classname>QListView</classname>, </para>

  <programlisting>
void returnPressed ( QListViewItem * ) 
  </programlisting>

<para id="para-documentation-29">Becomes:</para>

  <programlisting>
    self.connect(self,
                 SIGNAL("returnPressed(QListViewItem *)"),
                 self.slotItemSelected)
  </programlisting>
 
  <para id="para-documentation-30">The Qt documentation is not always
    consistent in giving signal parameters variable names - sometimes
    they do, sometimes they don't.</para>

  <para id="para-documentation-31">Finally, wherever there is a NULL
    in C++, you can use None, but you can also use None in many cases
    where there is a zero (0) (this being a pointer to nowhere). That
    means that everywhere a function takes an object (instead of a
    simple integer) as a parameter, you can use None. A zero is often
    given as a default argument in these cases, and then you don't
    need to give any parameter. Thus:</para>

  <programlisting>
QListView ( QWidget * parent = 0, const char * name = 0 ) 
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-32">Can be called as:</para>

  <programlisting>
listview = QListView(None, None)
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-33">or:</para>

  <programlisting>
listview = QListView()
  </programlisting>

  <para id="para-documentation-34">You can also use actual arguments,
    of course. You almost never need to actually pass something for
    the <varname>name</varname> parameter, but it makes for nicer
    debugging:</para>

  <programlisting>
listview = QListView(parentWindows, "listview")
  </programlisting>

    <!-- todo: I think it's not ideal to start a paragraph with "but
  also..." Br: Ok.-->
 

  <para>As you've seen, it's not difficult at all to translate from
    C++ to Python &mdash; even if you don't know any C or C++. If you
    do want to know more about C++, I can recommend Steven Oualline's
    book, <citetitle>Practical C++ Programming</citetitle> as a good
    beginners title.</para>
