></H1
><P
>All components that combine to form a PyQt
      development environment are also freely available. Python, Qt,
      Qt Designer, sip, PyQt and editors are all available as open
      source. If you use Linux&#8212;and particularly if you use a
      modern and complete distribution like SuSE or
      Redhat&#8212;everything you need is included on your
      distribution media, including PyQt. There are also Debian
      packages of PyQt available. Installing these ready-made packages
      is very easy, but they are not always completely up-to-date. In
      the next section, I will discuss building PyQt from source,
      which is necessary if you want to always run the latest version
      of PyQt.</P
><P
>Windows users who want to use PyQt without
      BlackAdder have some downloading to do, but all components are
      available as binary packages that come with easy to use Windows
      installers.</P
><P
>Installing PyQt from source on Windows falls outside the
      scope of this book, partly because it is quite complicated, and
      partly because I don't have a C++ compiler for Windows. The Qt
      library essentially demands Visual C++.</P
><P
>You can also access the PyQt CVS
      repository (the central place where the most current code is
      kept &#8212; also at http://www.thekompany.com). Compiling PyQt
      from CVS source entails creating the C++ bindings code from the
      sip definition files, and then carrying on as if you had
      downloaded the source. Keep in mind that CVS versions of
      software are not expected to work!</P

>Assuming you already have an
        installation of Python and Qt, you first need to gather the
        following packages if you want to build PyQt from
        source:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>sip</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>PyQt</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Eventually: PyKDE</P
></LI

><P
>Be careful to choose versions of
        packages that fit each other. You can compile PyQt with most
        versions of Qt, but Python 2.1 will give better results than
        Python 2.0, and so on.</P
><P
>You need to compile and install sip
        before compiling PyQt. After unpacking the sip tar archive,
        you will need to give the following commands:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>        boud@calcifer:~/src/sip-2.5 &#62; ./configure; make
      </PRE
><P
>And, when building is complete, become
        superuser and type:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>        root@calcifer:/home/boud/src/sip-2.5 &#62; make install
      </PRE
><P
>If your Python or Qt installation is in
        an odd place, then chances are that the
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> script cannot find it. In that
        case, you should give their locations on the command
        line:</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>        boud@calcifer:~/src/sip-2.5 &#62; ./configure \
        --with-qt-dir=/opt/qt \ --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python
      </PRE
><P
>This will build the sip library and
        executable, and install them (most likely in
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/</TT
>). With this done, it is time
        to do the same with PyQt. This time, the make command will
        take a long time to run, because PyQt is a very large set of
        bindings, and the GNU C++ compiler isn't the fastest
        around.</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>        boud@calcifer:~/src/PyQt-2.5 &#62; ./configure; make ...
        boud@calcifer:~/src/PyQt-2.5 &#62; su Password:
        root@calcifer:/home/boud/src/PyQt-2.5 &#62; make install
      </PRE

        but should not pose any problem. Sometimes, however, things go
        wrong...</P

          exercise to be attempted only by the technically adept.
          Certain problems have cropped up throughout the life of
          PyQt, only to be solved in later versions. Other problems
          have been caused by the version of the GNU C++ compiler used
          in certain releases of Redhat: gcc 2.96.</P
><P
>If you are experiencing problems, you
          probably have several versions of Python or Qt on your
          system, and the compilation configuration process inevitably
          picks the wrong one &#8212; for instance Qt 2.3.1 for sip
          and then Qt 3.0.0 for PyQt. Murphy's law cannot be avoided!
          This hurts compilation &#8212; but is easily avoided by
          giving the right versions at the ./configure command
          line.</P
><P
>If you have determined that this is
          not the problem, your best bet will be to subscribe to the
          PyQt mailinglist: http://mats.gmd.de/mailman/listinfo/pykde,
          where most of us have found succor more than once.</P

>You can develop applications on Windows
        systems with PyQt using only gratis software. Life will
        certainly be more difficult than if you buy BlackAdder,
        because you miss the nice integration of editor, debugger and
        operating system. Another issue is licensing: if you buy the
        professional edition of BlackAdder, you can write commercial
        software. If you use the non-commercial version of the Qt
        library and the separately available packages of sip and PyQt,
        you are not allowed to sell your programs: you are not even
        allowed to use your software yourself in a commercial setting.
        However, if you want to develop PyQt on windows without
        spending any money, you need the following components:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The Non-commercial licensed Qt
            library from http://www.trolltech.com. This a full version
            of Qt. You cannot build commercial applications with this
            library, and you cannot use your software in a commercial
            setting. Additionally, you must make the source to your
            software available. See
            http://www.trolltech.com/products/download/freelicense/noncommercial-dl.html 
            for more information.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>You also need the precompiled PyQt
            for Windows library from
            http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde/. This is made
            available under the same license as the non-commercial
            version of Qt. You don't need to download a separate copy
            of sip.           
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Of course, Python is needed, too! Get it from
            http://www.python.org.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>You also need a nice editor to type your
        Python code with. notepad just won't do - SciTE, which uses
        the same editor component as BlackAdder, is very powerful and
        pleasant to use. Get SciTE from
        http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html. (SciTE is also available
        for Linux.)</P
